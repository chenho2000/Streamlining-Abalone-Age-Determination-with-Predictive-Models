# Streamlining Abalone Age Determination with Predictive Models
Abalone is a type of mollusk with a convex, rounded to oval shell that can vary from highly arched to flattened. It is widely liked for its taste and nutritional value across the world. Beyond culinary appeal, abalone are farmed for their decorative shells, which are highly prized economically. The price of abalone correlates positively with its age, determined by counting growth rings that appear annually inside its shell. This process in- volves cutting the shell, polishing, staining, and counting rings under a microscope which is a labour-intensive task. The research question of this project aims to explore predicting abalone age using easily obtainable physical measurements, offering a faster alternative to microscopic ring counting. By analyzing attributes such as shell size and weight, predictive models can efficiently estimate abalone age, establishing correlations between these measur- able features and the number of rings
